            Hi, my name is Oriol and as I said, I have also experienced firsthand what it means to scale and grow a
            company, with very few resources and very quickly. And it's tough, I know. But we live in the era of no-code
            and AI, and I wondered if there weren't better ways than Excels, Docs and Slides.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's where I discovered tools like Webflow, Airtable or Notion that allowed me to create programs,
            websites, processes, forms starting from scratch, with total flexibility and improving them as the project
            evolved.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I introduced Notion in my startup, as our central tool for information and projects, everything
            changed. The most heard word in the office and on Slack was "this is in Notion" it wasn't easy for the team
            to integrate it into their daily routine, but we finally achieved it, I'll tell you that in 90% of cases.
          </p>

          <p>
            All our weeklys, meeting notes, projects, processes, OKRs... everything lived in one place and was
            interconnected.
          </p>

          <p>
            And at that moment Notion AI appeared, and I thought: what if we could help other companies achieve the
            same? What if we could help them organize their information and processes in a way that makes sense for
            them?
